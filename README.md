# Task 1: Responsive Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive and responsive navigation menu. The menu is designed to remain fixed at the top of the page, ensuring constant visibility as users scroll through the website. The menu items dynamically change in style when users hover over them, providing visual feedback through background and font color transitions.

The project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to implement the following features:

- A fixed navigation bar that stays in place during scrolling.
- Hover effects that change the background and font colors of the menu items.
- Smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup structure for the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the navigation menu and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Handling dynamic behavior for hover effects and transitions.

## Features
- **Fixed Navigation**: The menu remains visible at the top of the page while scrolling.
- **Hover Effects**: Changes in background and font color when users hover over each menu item.
